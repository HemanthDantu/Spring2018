        <td>Hemanth Dantu</td>
        <td>With a focus on CMOS Digital technology this course covers the basic concepts of integrated circuits, various methods of designing VLSI circuits, and techniques to analyze performance metrics (speed, area, power and noise). Clocking, interconnect and scaling issues of integrated circuit will also be discussed. It will cover device, interconnect and circuit level implementation issues of both logic and memory circuits.</td>
